# News Site

First technigo project creating a news site about plants.

## The problem

I used Figma for planning my project and also pen and paper which was really good. I had a lot of problems on the way but managed to google around and solve most of them. If I would have more time and I would not have spilled water on my computer so I needed to send it on reparation I would have more time and be less stressed so no more drinking water next to my computer. BIG LESSON!
